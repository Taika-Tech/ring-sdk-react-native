# RingSDK

RingSDK is a powerful and easy-to-use SDK for integrating the Taika Ring into your applications. This SDK provides functionalities to control the ring, configure settings, and interact with other devices via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js (>=12.x)
- npm (>=6.x)
- TypeScript (>=4.x)

## Installation

### Installing RingSDK in an Existing Project

To install the RingSDK in your existing React Native project, follow these steps:

1. **Install the RingSDK Package:**

Make sure you are in the root of your project, then run:

  ```sh
   npm install ring-sdk-react-native
   cd ringsdk
  ```

2. **iOS Only: Install CocoaPods Dependencies:**

Change to the ios directory and install the CocoaPods dependencies:

  ```sh
  cd ios
  pod install
  cd ..
  ```

3. **Link Native Dependencies:**

For React Native versions 0.60 and above, the native dependencies are linked automatically. For older versions, you might need to link manually.

4. **Set up Bluetooth permissions**

If you project didn't use Bluetooth before adding RingSDK, you need to add Bluetooth usage permissions for the app.

To do this, follow the [Setting Up Bluetooth Permissions](#setting-up-bluetooth-permissions) section.

6. **Run the Project:**

To run your React Native project with the integrated RingSDK, use the following command:

  ```sh
  npx react-native run-ios --device "My Device Name"  # For iOS
  npx react-native run-android                        # For Android
  ```
### Creating a New Project and Installing RingSDK

To create a new React Native project and integrate the RingSDK, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize a New React Native Project:**

  ```sh
  npx react-native init myAppName
  cd myAppName
  ```

2. **Install the RingSDK Package:**

  ```sh
   npm install ring-sdk-react-native
  ```

3. **iOS Only: Install CocoaPods Dependencies:**

Change to the ios directory, install the CocoaPods dependencies, and configure Xcode for signing:

  ```sh
  cd ios
  pod install
  open myAppName.xcworkspace 
  ```
In Xcode, click on myAppName in the project navigator, go to the Signing & Capabilities tab, and select your team for signing.

After configuring signing in Xcode, return to the root directory:

  ```sh
  cd ..
  ```

4. **Set up Bluetooth permissions**

To use RingSDK in your new project, you need to add Bluetooth usage permissions for the app.

To do this, follow the [Setting Up Bluetooth Permissions](#setting-up-bluetooth-permissions) section.

5. **Run the Project:**

To run your React Native project with the integrated RingSDK, use the following command:

  ```sh
  npx react-native run-ios --device "My Device Name"  # For iOS
  npx react-native run-android                        # For Android
  ```


## Setting Up Bluetooth Permissions

If your project didn't use Bluetooth before adding the RingSDK or you are creating a new project, you need to add Bluetooth usage permissions for the app. The RingSDK will handle asking for the permissions, but you need to set them up in the podfile and/or Android manifest.

### iOS Setup

1. **Info.plist**: Add the following entries to your `ios/MyAppName/Info.plist` file to request Bluetooth permissions.

   ```xml
   <key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to Bluetooth to connect to the ring.</string>
   <key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to Bluetooth to connect to the ring.</string>
   <key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your location to use Bluetooth.</string>
   <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
   <string>We need access to your location to use Bluetooth.</string>
   ```

### Android Setup

1. **AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the following permissions to your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file to request Bluetooth permissions.

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />

   <!-- Required for Bluetooth LE -->
   <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.bluetooth_le" android:required="true"/>
   ```

2. **Gradle Configuration**: Ensure that your `android/build.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle` files are configured to use the correct SDK versions.

   In `android/build.gradle`:

   ```gradle
   buildscript {
       ext {
           buildToolsVersion = "30.0.3"
           minSdkVersion = 21
           compileSdkVersion = 30
           targetSdkVersion = 30
       }
   }
   ```

   In `android/app/build.gradle`:

   ```gradle
   android {
       compileSdkVersion rootProject.ext.compileSdkVersion

       defaultConfig {
           minSdkVersion rootProject.ext.minSdkVersion
           targetSdkVersion rootProject.ext.targetSdkVersion
       }
   }
   ```

### Follow the react-native-ble-plx Setup Guide

For detailed setup instructions, follow the [react-native-ble-plx setup guide](https://github.com/Polidea/react-native-ble-plx/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#ios-example-setup) for both iOS and Android.


## Basic Setup

### Example App

Hereâ€™s a simplified example app that shows how to use the RingSDK to show live touch coordinates on the ring's touchpad.

  ```typescript
  import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
  import { SafeAreaView, Text } from 'react-native';
  import { BleManager } from 'react-native-ble-plx';
  import { initializeRing, onTouchEvent } from 'ring-sdk-react-native';
  
  // Create a Bluetooth manager from the package react-native-ble-plx
  const manager = new BleManager();
  
  const App: React.FC = () => {
    const [touchpadXValue, setTouchpadXValue] = useState('0.00');
    const [touchpadYValue, setTouchpadYValue] = useState('0.00');
  
    useEffect(() => {
      const setupSDK = async () => {
        // Initialize the ring by passing the Bluetooth manager to the initializer function
        await initializeRing(manager);
        console.log('Ring is initialized.');
      };
      setupSDK();
  
      // Event handler for touch events
      const handleTouchEvent = (data: any) => {
        console.log('New touch data received:', data.x, data.y);
        setTouchpadXValue(data.x.toFixed(2));
        setTouchpadYValue(data.y.toFixed(2));
      };
  
      // Set the touch event callback
      onTouchEvent(handleTouchEvent);
  
      return () => {
        // Destroy Bluetooth manager upon exit
        manager.destroy();
      };
    }, []);
  
    return (
      <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Touchpad X: {touchpadXValue}</Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Touchpad Y: {touchpadYValue}</Text>
      </SafeAreaView>
    );
  };
  
  const styles = {
    container: {
      flex: 1,
      justifyContent: 'center',
      alignItems: 'center',
    },
    text: {
      fontSize: 18,
      margin: 10,
    },
  };
  
  export default App;

  ```

### Explanation

 - **Bluetooth Manager:** A Bluetooth manager is created using the react-native-ble-plx package.
 - **Initialization:** The initializeRing function is used to initialize the ring and set up the necessary Bluetooth connections.
 - **State Management:** The component maintains state for the touchpad values.
 - **Event Handlers:** Event handlers are set up to handle touch events from the ring.

Certainly! Here is the bitmask section formatted for your README file, along with an explanation on how it is used in the `TouchData` struct:

## API Reference

### Context Interfaces

- **MotionData**
  ```typescript
  interface MotionData {
    acc: Vector3;
    gyro: Vector3;
    mag: Vector3;
    orientationRelative: Vector4;
    orientationAbsolute: Vector4;
  }
  ```

- **Vector3**
  ```typescript
  interface Vector3 {
    x: number;
    y: number;
    z: number;
  }
  ```

- **Vector4**
  ```typescript
  interface Vector4 {
    x: number;
    y: number;
    z: number;
    w: number;
  }
  ```

- **TouchData**
  ```typescript
  interface TouchData {
    touchActive: boolean;
    x: number;
    y: number;
    touchStrength: number;
    timestamp: number;
    touchpadEventMask: TouchEventMask;
  }
  ```

### Touch Event Bitmask

The `TouchEventMask` is a bitmask that represents various touch events. Bitmasks allow us to represent multiple boolean flags in a single number, with each bit in the number representing a different flag.

#### TouchEvent Enum

  ```typescript
  export enum TouchEvent {
      TOUCH_ACTIVE = 1 << 0,          // 1st bit, hexadecimal 1
      TOUCH_START = 1 << 1,           // 2nd bit, hexadecimal 2
      TOUCH_END = 1 << 2,             // 3rd bit, hexadecimal 4
      TOUCH_TOP = 1 << 3,             // 4th bit, hexadecimal 8 (0x00000008)
      TOUCH_SIDE = 1 << 4,            // 5th bit, hexadecimal 10 (0x00000010)

      GESTURE_EVENT = 1 << 5,         // 6th bit, hex 20 
      LOW_POWER_OUTPUT = 1 << 6,      // 7th bit, hex 40 

      HOLD_START = 1 << 8,            // 9th bit, hex 80
      HOLD_RELEASE = 1 << 9,          // 10th bit, hex 100
      HOLD_ONGOING = 1 << 10,         // 11th bit, hex 200

      SINGLE_TAP = 1 << 11,           // 12th bit, hex 400
      DOUBLE_TAP = 1 << 12,           // 13th bit
      TRIPLE_TAP = 1 << 13,           // 14th bit

      SLOW_SWIPE_UP = 1 << 16,        // 17th bit 
      SLOW_SWIPE_DOWN = 1 << 17,      // 18th bit 
      SLOW_SWIPE_LEFT = 1 << 18,      // 19th bit 
      SLOW_SWIPE_RIGHT = 1 << 19,     // 20th bit

      SWIPE_UP = 1 << 20,             // 21st bit
      SWIPE_DOWN = 1 << 21,           // 22nd bit 
      SWIPE_LEFT = 1 << 22,           // 23rd bit
      SWIPE_RIGHT = 1 << 23,          // 24th bit

      PM_ACTIVE = 1 << 26,            // 27th bit
      PM_IDLE = 1 << 27,              // 28th bit
      PM_LOW_POWER = 1 << 28,         // 29th bit
      PM_TO_ACTIVE = 1 << 29,         // 30th bit
      PM_TO_IDLE = 1 << 30,           // 31st bit 
      PM_TO_LOW_POWER = 1 << 31       // 32nd bit
  }
    
  export type TouchEventMask = number;
  ```

### Usage in TouchData

In the `TouchData` struct, the `touchpadEventMask` field uses the `TouchEventMask` type to represent various touch events using a bitmask. This allows multiple touch events to be captured and represented in a single number. For example, if multiple touch events occur simultaneously, they can be combined using the bitwise OR operator (`|`), and individual events can be checked using the bitwise AND operator (`&`).

#### Example Usage

To set multiple touch events, combine them using the bitwise OR operator (`|`):
```typescript
let events: TouchEventMask = TouchEvent.TOUCH_START | TouchEvent.SINGLE_TAP | TouchEvent.SWIPE_UP;
```

To check if a specific touch event is set, use the bitwise AND operator (`&`):
```typescript
if (events & TouchEvent.SINGLE_TAP) {
  // Single tap event is set
}
```
